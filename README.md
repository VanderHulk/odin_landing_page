# odin_landing_page
An odin project about flexbox.

I applied the concept of responsive design in this project, thanks to the tutorial from Slaying The Dragon YouTube channel: [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLDn_k8GmaU&list=LL&index=1). I also learned about using CSS variables from the same tutorial and have incorporated them into this project. For responsive font sizing, I followed the guidance from both the tutorial and the Tailwind CSS documentation https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size.

Iâ€™ve only made minimal changes to the original, such as adjusting the font style and modifying some of the text.

The Hamburger svg icon was from https://heroicons.com/.

I used the Satoshi font from https://fontshare.com/.

I hope to learn how to incorporate a JavaScript menu that toggles when the hamburger button is clicked.
